# git-r

This is an experiment to learn the internals of git by reimplementing the git commands from scratch in Rust.

Taking reference from https://wyag.thb.lt/ , which is a python implementation of git.

### What can git-r do?
git-r is currently a WIP and does not have any active functionality. soon :)

### Running the application
- Setup rust on your local, follow https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- `cargo run` / `cargo run --release`
